I am following the tutorial by Cadiboo at https://cadiboo.github.io/ as it is slowly released.
I am not very good at modding!

The main aim of this project is to learn to mod, not to create a mod in particular, this means that whilst I will try
to keep most things to a theme there is some amount of freedom with this.

Don't judge me too hard please :(
